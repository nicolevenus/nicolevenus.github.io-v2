The Representation of Female Economists on Wikipedia
> This paper is the first to examine the gender gap in the representation of economists on Wikipedia. Based on a large sample of actively-publishing economists, I document that women were unconditionally less than half as likely to have a biographical entry than men. Conditioning on Wikipedia's notability criteria proxied by a wide set of author characteristics reduces the gender gap to 9%. Over time, this gap closed due to a strong increase in contributions by Wikipedia editors affiliated with initiatives promoting gender equality. Non-affiliated editors, who were over-selecting men in the 2000s, have selected subjects in a gender-neutral way since then.
